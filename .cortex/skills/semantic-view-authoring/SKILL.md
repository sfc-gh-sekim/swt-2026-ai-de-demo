# Instructions

Semantic Views are a recent Snowflake feature and the `dbt_semantic_view`
package is newer still - do not rely on memorized patterns from other tools
(LookML, dbt MetricFlow, Cube, etc.). Follow the rules below exactly.

A semantic view model is materialized as:

```
{{ config(materialized='semantic_view') }}
TABLES ( ... ) RELATIONSHIPS ( ... ) FACTS ( ... ) DIMENSIONS ( ... ) METRICS ( ... )
COMMENT = '...' AI_VERIFIED_QUERIES ( ... )
```

The package wraps the body in `CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW <relation> <body>`.
You write everything after the relation name.

## Rules (in order)

1. **Clause order is mandatory:** `TABLES`, `RELATIONSHIPS`, `FACTS`,
   `DIMENSIONS`, `METRICS`, `COMMENT`, then `AI_VERIFIED_QUERIES`. Snowflake
   rejects out-of-order clauses (FACTS must precede DIMENSIONS, etc.).
2. **Reference dbt models, not raw tables.** Every logical table is
   `alias AS {{ ref('model_name') }}`. Never hard-code a database/schema.
3. **Declare keys and relationships.** Give each logical table a `PRIMARY KEY`,
   and declare every join in `RELATIONSHIPS` as
   `rel_name AS child (fk_col) REFERENCES parent (pk_col)`.
4. **Define the metric explicitly - do not assume column names imply meaning.**
   If multiple plausible measures exist (e.g. a header total vs. a line-derived
   net figure), the metric SQL must state which one is official, and the
   ambiguous column should carry a COMMENT saying it is NOT the metric.

## Team metadata standards (required)

- **Every** dimension and metric has `WITH SYNONYMS = (...)`.
- **Every** metric and any ambiguous fact has a `COMMENT` stating its exact
  business definition.
- The view has a top-level `COMMENT` describing its analytic purpose.
- Provide at least two `AI_VERIFIED_QUERIES`, with `ONBOARDING_QUESTION TRUE` on
  the best starter questions. Write their `SQL` against the semantic view using
  the **unqualified** view name (e.g. `FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(sv_sales_analytics ...)`)
  so the same query is valid in DEV and PROD.
- Mark internal-only measures `PRIVATE`; everything queryable is `PUBLIC`.

## Validation workflow (always do this)

1. `dbt parse` to catch Jinja/ref errors.
2. Build the view: `dbt run --select <sv_model> --target dev`
3. Smoke-test a real question through the view:
   `SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(<db>.<schema>.<sv> METRICS <m> DIMENSIONS <d>);`
4. `DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW <db>.<schema>.<sv>;` and confirm synonyms/comments
   persisted.

# PR Review checklist (developers and CI)

Verify each item and report pass/fail with file:line refs and a concrete fix for every failure:

1. Clause order: TABLES, RELATIONSHIPS, FACTS, DIMENSIONS, METRICS, COMMENT,
   AI_VERIFIED_QUERIES.
2. Every logical table has a PRIMARY KEY; every join is declared in RELATIONSHIPS.
3. Logical tables reference dbt models via `{{ ref(...) }}` (no hard-coded
   database/schema).
4. Every dimension and metric has `WITH SYNONYMS`.
5. Every metric (and any ambiguous fact) has a definition COMMENT; the view has a
   top-level COMMENT.
6. At least two AI_VERIFIED_QUERIES, written against the **unqualified** view name.
7. Internal-only measures marked PRIVATE.

Output: concise markdown titled by the model file, grouped into Pass / Fail, with
file:line references and a concrete fix for each failure. Do not modify any files.

Write the review in the language the reviewer asked in. When the request is in
Korean, write the findings and the section headings in Korean ('통과' / '실패')
even though this checklist is written in English. Always leave SQL identifiers,
clause names (TABLES, FACTS, METRICS, ...) and file paths untranslated.

# Best Practices

- One semantic view per analytic subject area; keep it small and curated.
- Prefer a clean star (fact + dimension) over stuffing many tables in one view.
- Name metrics for the business concept (`total_revenue`), not the SQL
  (`sum_net_rev`).
- Treat the verified queries as regression tests for the model's intent.

# Common Patterns

## Pattern 1: Disambiguating "revenue"

Define the metric explicitly and comment the trap column:

```
FACTS (
  orders.net_revenue AS orders.net_revenue
    COMMENT = 'Line-derived net revenue: extended_price * (1 - discount).',
  orders.order_total AS orders.order_total
    COMMENT = 'Header price; includes tax. NOT the official revenue metric.'
)
METRICS (
  orders.total_revenue AS SUM(orders.net_revenue)
    WITH SYNONYMS = ('revenue', 'net revenue', 'total sales')
    COMMENT = 'Official revenue: SUM of line-derived net revenue.'
)
```
